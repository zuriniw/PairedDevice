# PairedDevice
## To run the code
- Open the `Seesaw` file, and that is all you need.
- Prepare 2 photon 2, make sure you have registered 2 Particle account.
- Set up 2 webhooks on each sides.
- Fill out the sketches in Particle Web IDE of your 2 photons.
- In my case, Device 1 is ZW's photon 2, while device 2 is LL's photon 2. There are some unknown issues with LL's photon 2 that lead to the disconnection when powered the linear actuator with 12v power supply. So I adjust the preset speed and total length in the file `device_2` to make the position reaching correct.
