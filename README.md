# PairedDevice

## To run the code
- Open the `Seesaw` file; this is all you need to get started.
- Prepare two Photon 2 devices, and make sure you have registered two Particle accounts.
- Set up two webhooks, one for each device.
- Fill out the sketches in the Particle Web IDE for your two photons.
- In my case, Device 1 is ZW's Photon 2, while Device 2 is LL's Photon 2. There are some unknown issues with LL's Photon 2 that lead to disconnections when powering the linear actuator with a 12V power supply. Therefore, I adjusted the preset speed and total length in the `device_2` file to ensure the position reaches correctly.
